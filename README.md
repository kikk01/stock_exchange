# Calcul stock exchange gain
For now it's just a little algorithm to calcul your gain if you invest xâ‚¬, with r rate you choose by day, every day, for y years.
The result is based on a PEA-PME including cost orders from [Boursorama](https://s.brsimg.com/pub/brochure_tarifaire/boursorama_bt.pdf) and optimized tax (free tax)

Depending feedback I will improve project
